# CDK Boilerplate

## Open Questions & To-Do

- [ ] How to have a concept of stage (similar to serverless) in CDK. For example table names prefixed with a stage.
- [ ] Based on that, you can create another deployment stage in the pipeline to a different stage.
- [ ] You can also introduce a manual approval stage before the deployment to "production" stage. Other complex cases, such as deploying to a different account is advanced topic and within the realm of Cloud Architect.
- [ ] Writing integration tests and appropriately automatically testing them.
- [ ] Writing infrastructure tests.
- [ ] Writing unit tests

The above questions can be investigated individually and not necessarily to be done in this project.
